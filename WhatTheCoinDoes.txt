Funding token will be used to fund projects.

it will be some kind funding platform for investors into the real economy.

investors will be able to pledge some amount of funding to a project, by staking it into the projects project contract,
and in return they will get tokens from the project.

investors will be able to withdraw their support before a project is fully funded.
they will also be able to use leverage on the pledge. meaning they willing to fund the project more in the future.
since it  can take a very long time before a project is fully funded it would be sad for all the funds to be locked up waiting.

you will be able to earn stake rewards on the full amount pledged, if you actually will invest in the project when founding is finished.
to withdraw before funding you will need to send the full amount pledged first.

to be continued...
