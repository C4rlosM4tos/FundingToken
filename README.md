*** CONTRACT RUNNING ON FANTOM CHAIN (live) *** 

(eth miners didn't want 500$ fee for 3hours+, i got tired waiting...

0x9f166e3d840FF8804AF9E867BA5Cfc1cd1cF2Ca1
----------------------------------------------------------------------

started trading on contract at 1 FTM = 1.01 HOPE  putting 1 HOPE at 10 cents $ ponzi market value.

total market cap 20 cents. (contract can mint new coins based on deposits)

fees paid to get the FTM and contract: 101 FTM

wasted doing it wrong to ETH network: 110 FTM + 15$ eth

stuck on eth network for pending contract: 0.4 eth

expensive meme, but i must have HOPE !!!!

- users should be able to sell less than 1 coin now (min tot value 1 wei).
- removed bug of real value getting rounded when selling fraction of a coin.





plz play around, use faucet eth

you can go to Remix online ide, and add all the contracts. import using github link or manual.

you might need to change the "import" location of some files, but i tried to flatten them out so its all ./filename

If i can do it, you can do it even faster.



plz help to find bugs, errors or bad code.
maybe some things should be private or internal instead of public... 
plz try to hack it if that is your skillset. (and let me know what to change after ;) )

Thank you in advance
