***** HOW TO UNISWAP **********

the easy way: download the metamask plugin (if not using brave) so you can easily connect to web3 websites.

Uniswap also supports some wallets:
- walletconnect
- coinbasewallet
- Portis
- Fortmatic


Just go to the website and click: use uniswap

metamask should popup to ask if it is allowed to connect to the wallet.
you can also click on "connect to wallet' on top right corner if it doesn't go auto.

On select a token, give the contract address of the token you want to buy:

Buy the coin from the smart contract and add liquidity plz, i already had to sell some corn to get enough eth.
This meme costed much more than expected, but after that failed transaction it was too hard too leave.

i actually tried to cancel it, but sadly didn't work. 

Could use help with front-end.

and if you have a project or dream  in mind you want to get fundend, plz keep following for the funding platform release.
