HOPE


***Poopcoin*** erc20


read what the coin does if you want to know more

contract is running on ropsten for testing:

Main contract is HOPE.sol

(0x9f166e3d840FF8804AF9E867BA5Cfc1cd1cF2Ca1) (old contract)

**** NEW CONTRACT ***

0x22c1E7B6E8632F4ac949f309Cc86d935e7135739

----------------------------------------------------------------------

- users should be able to sell less than 1 coin now (min tot value 1 wei).
- removed bug of real value getting rounded when selling fraction of a coin.


- notice: when buying and selling the first coins the price seemed to have pumped from 100 to 6000 wei, something wrong with payout leaving too much funds in the contract or what?



plz play around, use faucet eth

https://faucet.dimensions.network/
https://faucet.metamask.io/



you can go to Remix online ide, and add all the contracts. import using github link or manual.

you might need to change the "import" location of some files, but i tried to flatten them out so its all ./filename

If i can do it, you can do it even faster.



plz help to find bugs, errors or bad code.
maybe some things should be private or internal instead of public... 
plz try to hack it if that is your skillset. (and let me know what to change after ;) )

Thank you in advance
